# ArduinoProjects
Small projects to familiarize yourself with the workings of an Arduino. My projects are constructed based on an ELEGOO UNO R3 with additional accessories purchased from this link: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01D8KOZF4?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details


# Proximity Sensor
This project utilizes the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to read and display distances on to a LCD display. If the detected distance is below 5 centimeters (2 inches), the display will show a warning message, the RGB led will flash red, and the buzzer will vibrate at a different frequency. 

Required for the project is: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, LCD 1602 Module, RGB LED, Passive Buzzer, Potentiometer, 26 Jumper Wires (Various Lengths).

# Temperature and Humidity Sensor
Using the DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor this project retrives and displays temperature and humidity readings in any given area. The temperature is displayed in celsius and humidity is displayed as a percent which are directly pulled from the associated DHT Sensor library.

# Mini Piano
This project utilizes a passive buzzer and the tone functions to play notes of a piano. The project is expandable to as many tones as wanted.
